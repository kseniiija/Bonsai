                    Shohin Bonsai Dubai
                    The word Shohin means "a small thing," and "Bonsai" is a Japanese term that denotes "planted in a container." The artistic growth of Bonsai plants has its root in ancient Chinese horticultural practices. The Japanese Zen Buddhists developed their technique.
                    <br />
                    Bonsai is a status symbol, as only the wealthy and known samurai and royal families owned it.
                    <br />
                    Bonsai horticulture is the art of nurturing miniature trees into beautiful patterns and dimensions of local and global trees. It's simply perfecting nature for indoor aesthetic beautification.
                    <br />
                    Shohin Bonsai is the only place in Dubai and UAE where you can find handcrafted and nurtured Bonsai plants for your love of quality. I am a direct bonsai artist who takes an average of two years to cultivate bonsai trees. I am not a reseller.
                    <br />
                    Shohin Bonsai invests massive efforts into nurturing these plants from their basic form until they attain aesthetic perfection, bringing out the bonsai plant's beauty. I leverage the best in-house soil mix from the USA and Japan to grow my Bonsai trees. Shohin Bonsai studies and carefully select the best fertilizer for the growth process – this is why my bonsai trees are very healthy and visually appealing.
                    Bonsai trees are air-purifying for indoor purposes, and they're beautiful corner plants for outdoor purposes.

                    Great Bonsai starts with Great material, "Tree,". It can be found in nature (yamadori) or in any plant shop. It takes a keen eye and experience to choose the right one.
                    One of the most important parts, if not the most critical factor when making a bonsai is branches selection and shaping.
                    Its the deal-breaker for a bonsai, whether it survives or no.
                    A personal favorite of mine, the differentiator between an artist and someone just using scissors to cut some branches.a
