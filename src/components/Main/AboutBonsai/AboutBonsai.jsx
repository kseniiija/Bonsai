                <p>The word Shohin means "a small thing," and "Bonsai" is a Japanese term that denotes "planted in a container." The artistic growth of Bonsai plants has its root in ancient Chinese horticultural practices. The Japanese Zen Buddhists developed their technique.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Bonsai is a status symbol, as only the wealthy and known samurai and royal families owned it.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Bonsai horticulture is the art of nurturing miniature trees into beautiful patterns and dimensions of local and global trees. It's simply perfecting nature for indoor aesthetic beautification.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Shohin Bonsai is the only place in Dubai and UAE where you can find handcrafted and nurtured Bonsai plants for your love of quality. I am a direct bonsai artist who takes an average of two years to cultivate bonsai trees. I am not a reseller.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Shohin Bonsai invests massive efforts into nurturing these plants from their basic form until they attain aesthetic perfection, bringing out the bonsai plant's beauty. I leverage the best in-house soil mix from the USA and Japan to grow my Bonsai trees. Shohin Bonsai studies and carefully select the best fertilizer for the growth process â€“ this is why my bonsai trees are very healthy and visually appealing.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Bonsai trees are air-purifying for indoor purposes, and they're beautiful corner plants for outdoor purposes.</p>
                <br />
